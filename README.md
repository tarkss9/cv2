This was my first time doing a small CV2 project


In order to use the code correctly: Open the terminal and type


pip install ultralytics/n
pip install YOLO/n
pip install cv2/n
pip install cvzone/n



If it doesn't work you can change the zero to one in line 5 :

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)



The code runs on Python 3.11


Wait a little while until it works
